# Zero to Hero: Neural Networks

From time to time I try new courses to keep up my knowledge or test my skills within Machine Learning. The course by Andrej Karpathy ["Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) is one of the best I've come across in a long time.

This repository contains my recreation of all the code implemented in that series. It serves as both a learning exercise and a reference for the concepts covered in the course.

## Course Overview

Andrej Karpathy's "Zero to Hero" series provides an in-depth exploration of neural networks, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced topics. The course covers:

- Fundamentals of neural networks
- Backpropagation
- Training techniques
- Various neural network architectures

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to follow the structure of the course, with each section corresponding to a specific video or concept covered. 

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you'll need:

1. Python 3.x
2. PyTorch
3. Other dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Acknowledgements

A huge thank you to Andrej Karpathy for creating this exceptional educational content and making it freely available.
